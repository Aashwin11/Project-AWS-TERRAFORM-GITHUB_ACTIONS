# Project: AWS Terraform GitHub Actions  
**Hosting a Static Website on DEV and PROD Environments via Modular Terraform & GitHub Actions**

---

## ðŸ“– Overview

This project demonstrates how to **provision, deploy, and manage a scalable static website on AWS** using **Terraform** (with a modular approach) and **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD.  
It features **two isolated environments** (DEV and PROD), automated infrastructure deployment and teardown, and environment-specific protection using GitHub Environments.

---

## Architecture

- **AWS Resources:**  
  - VPC, Subnets, Internet Gateway, Route Tables  
  - Application Load Balancer (ALB) and its Security Groups  
  - EC2 Instances (serving static HTML content)
  - Modularized Terraform code (`modules/` for `alb`, `alb-sg`, `ec2`, `ec2_sg`, `igw`, `route_table`, `subnet`, `vpc`)

- **Static Website Content:**  
  - Separate HTML files for DEV and PROD, stored under `html/dev/` and `html/prod/` respectively (e.g., `a.html`, `b.html`).

- **Configuration Files:**  
  - Environment-specific variable files:  
    - `environments/dev/terraform.tfvars`
    - `environments/prod/terraform.tfvars`
  - Remote backend configuration files:  
    - `backend-dev.tfbackend`
    - `backend-prod.tfbackend`

---

## CI/CD Workflow (GitHub Actions)

### 1. **Terraform Deployment Workflow (`deploy.yml`)**

- **Trigger:** Manual (`workflow_dispatch`) with environment selection (dev/prod)
- **Steps:**
  1. **Checkout code**
  2. **Setup Terraform**
  3. **Configure AWS credentials** (from repo/organization secrets)
  4. **Inject correct backend config**  
     - Copies the appropriate backend config (`backend-dev.tfbackend` or `backend-prod.tfbackend`) to `backend.tf` at runtime.
  5. **Terraform Init**  
     - Initializes the backend (only one backend config is present at a time to avoid conflicts).
  6. **Workspace selection/creation**  
     - Uses Terraform Workspaces to isolate state for each environment.
  7. **Terraform Plan & Apply**  
     - Applies changes using the environment-specific variable files.
  8. **Output**  
     - Displays Terraform outputs (e.g., ALB DNS, EC2 instance IDs).

### 2. **Terraform Destroy Workflow (`destroy.yml`)**

- **Trigger:** Manual (`workflow_dispatch`) with environment selection (dev/prod)
- **Steps:** Similar to deployment, but runs `terraform destroy` after selecting the workspace.

---

## Terraform Backend Strategy

**Problem:**  
Terraform supports only one backend configuration (`backend` block) per working directory. Having multiple backend configs (e.g., for dev and prod) with `.tf` extension causes errors (`Multiple backend blocks found`).  

**Solution:**  
- Store backend configs as `backend-dev.tfbackend` and `backend-prod.tfbackend` (no `.tf` extension).
- In the workflow, copy the relevant file to `backend.tf` **just before `terraform init`**.
- This ensures only one backend config is present and avoids conflicts.

---

## Environment Separation & Protection

- **Terraform Workspaces:**  
  - Isolates state between `dev` and `prod` (prevents resource overlap).

- **GitHub Environments:**  
  - Created `dev` and `prod` environments in repository settings.
  - **DEV:**  
    - No deployment protection rules (for rapid iteration/testing).
  - **PROD:**  
    - Deployment protection rules enforced:
      - **Review required by user:** `Aashwin11`
      - **Wait timer:** 1 minute before deployment can proceed

- **Secrets Management:**  
  - AWS credentials (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`) stored as encrypted GitHub Secrets, scoped per environment.

## How to Use

### **1. Deploy Infrastructure**
- Go to the **Actions** tab in GitHub.
- Select **Terraform Deployment Script** workflow.
- Click **Run workflow**, choose either `dev` or `prod`, and start the run.
- For `prod`, review and approve as required by deployment protection.

### **2. Destroy Infrastructure**
- Go to the **Terraform Destroy** workflow in Actions.
- Click **Run workflow**, choose the environment, and confirm.

## Example Website Output

Each EC2 instance hosts a static HTML page that dynamically displays:
- The **instance ID** (`$(hostname)`)
- The **environment** (DEV or PROD)
- Custom styling and effects
